DOCKER VERSION doesnt require any stuff installed other than xming, pretty fast and easy solution for lazy people like me

Repository of MOWNiT classes at AGH 2021. It includes all docker-related stuff to start with. Make sure **volume mapping is enabled** and **port 3000 is available**

**Dont forget to install Xming**

## Get started
- run build.ps1
- run run.ps1
- code in vs code(for instance) then make on console where you've just started run.ps1
